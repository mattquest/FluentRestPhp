# FluentRestPhp
Connection class used to access RESTful api's with a fluent interface.

This was pulled out of a current project I'm working on.  I'll be adding documentation, tests, a composer file with 
dependencies, etc, as time allows.  In the mean time, feel free to poke around and use it if you'd like!
